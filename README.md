=========================================
Version 1.0.1 - Pushed on 30th April 2013
-----

Added one new method and modified one method. Details as follows:-

 	bool isUserAlreadyLoginedToFacebook_Or_IsSessionActive = EziSocialObject::sharedObject()->isFacebookSessionActive();

While app is running, anytime if you like to know if user is actually logined to Facebook or not. Or whether session is expired or not. Just simply called above method.
There is no callback method of this and result will immediately return.

	EziSocialObject::sharedObject()->fetchFBUserDetails(true);

Definition of fetchUserDetails has been changed. Now you can actually fetch user email ID also. To get the user email ID, pass the value as true otherwise false.

_**NOTE**: If ask for user email ID, then first time it will ask extra permission from the app user to allow your app to see user email ID._

### HOW TO CHECK IF USER ALLOWED TO SEE HIS EMAIL ID OR NOT


In case user decide not to send you the email ID then in callback method, within Data Dictionary an Error message will return.

Use can check the error message as follows:-
	
    
    if (data)
    {
        if (data->objectForKey(KEY_FB_USER_ERROR))
        {
            CCMessageBox(((CCString*)(data->objectForKey(KEY_FB_USER_ERROR)))->getCString(), "Error");
            return;
        }
        
        mUsername->setString(((CCString*)(data->objectForKey(KEY_FB_USER_NAME)))->getCString());
        mGender->setString(((CCString*)(data->objectForKey(KEY_FB_USER_GENDER)))->getCString());
        mHometown->setString(((CCString*)(data->objectForKey(KEY_FB_USER_HOMETOWN)))->getCString());
        mPresentLocation->setString(((CCString*)(data->objectForKey(KEY_FB_USER_PRESENT_LOCATION)))->getCString());
        mProfileID->setString(((CCString*)(data->objectForKey(KEY_FB_USER_PROFILE_ID)))->getCString());
        mFirstName->setString(((CCString*)(data->objectForKey(KEY_FB_USER_FIRST_NAME)))->getCString());
        mLastName->setString(((CCString*)(data->objectForKey(KEY_FB_USER_LAST_NAME)))->getCString());
        mAccessToken->setString(((CCString*)(data->objectForKey(KEY_FB_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN)))->getCString());
        
        CCLOG("Access Token = %s", ((CCString*)(data->objectForKey(KEY_FB_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN)))->getCString());
        
        CCString* name = CCString::createWithFormat("%s %s", mFirstName->getString(), mLastName->getString(), NULL);
        mName->setString(name->getCString());
        
        /* Here is the email ID of the user */
        if (data->objectForKey(KEY_FB_USER_EMAIL))
        {
            CCLOG("User email ID = %s", ((CCString*)(data->objectForKey(KEY_FB_USER_EMAIL)))->getCString());
        }
        
        this->showUserDetailPage();
    }
    else
    {
        CCMessageBox("Sorry, user details not available", "fbUserDetailCallback");
    }



### Android Changes


To make this code working on Android side, you need to change onActivityResult(...) within Cocos2dxActivity as follows:-

	  		
	@Override
	public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data)
	{
		super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
		EziSocialManager.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
	}
	


### Debugging On Android


In version 1.0.1, you can enable Android debugging by calling following method in Any Java Class (prefer your MainActivity class):

	EziSocialManager.setEnableDebugLogs(false); // To disable logs. By Default, disable

	EziSocialManager.setEnableDebugLogs(true); // To enable logs. By Default, disable

## Major changes on code signatures

### Common to iOS and Android (CPP Code)

- Three new callbacks added in **EziSocialDelegate.h** class.


```ruby

    /* This method will be called whenever a request will come to app via Facebook. */
    virtual void fbRecieveRequestCallback(int responseCode,
                                          const char* message,
                                          const char* senderName, cocos2d::CCDictionary* dataDictionary) = 0;
    
    /* This methid will be called when app user send Facebook request: Invite, Challenge and Gift to his friends.
    It will return with response code nad list of the friends to whom request is sent. */
    virtual void fbSendRequestCallback(int responseCode, cocos2d::CCArray* friendsGotRequests) = 0;
    
    /* This method will be called whenever user profile pic is available for display. */
    virtual void fbUserPhotoCallback(const char *userPhotoPath) = 0;
```

- Six new methods added to **EziSocialObject.h** file to fullfill following request:-

#### To get the friends with a search filter. 

```ruby

    /* To get the list of Friends */
    /* It supports three kind of search filter.
    	- FB_FRIEND_SEARCH::ALL_FRIENDS
    	- FB_FRIEND_SEARCH::ONLY_INSTALLED
    	- FB_FRIEND_SEARCH::ONLY_INSTALLED
    */	
    	void getFriends(EziSocialWrapperNS::FB_FRIEND_SEARCH::TYPE searchType);

```
    
#### To apply range filter on the search filter on top of Search Filter.

```ruby
	/* A range filter can be applied on top of Search Filter.
	void getFriends(EziSocialWrapperNS::FB_FRIEND_SEARCH::TYPE searchType, int startIndex, int limit);
```

#### To get the user profile photo of default type: SQUARE

```ruby
	/* It will download the user profile picture with types: SQUARE
		- FBUSER::PIC_SQUARE
	*/
	void getProfilePicForID(const char* userFacebookID, bool forceDownload);
```

#### To get the user profile photo of facebook supported type

```ruby
	/* It will download the user profile picture with types: SQUARE, NORMAL, SMALL, LARGE
		- FBUSER::PIC_SQUARE
		- FBUSER::PIC_SMALL
		- FBUSER::PIC_NORMAL
		- FBUSER::PIC_LARGE
	
	if forcedownload = true, then it will download the photo from internet otherwise it will search
	first local storage.
	
	*/
	void getProfilePicForID(const char* userFacebookID, EziSocialWrapperNS::FBUSER::PROFILE_PIC_TYPE picType, bool forceDownload);
```

#### To get the user profile photo of custom height and width

```ruby
	/* It will download the user profile picture with custom width and height. 
	Facebook support MAX width and height is equal to 200x200.
	
	if forcedownload = true, then it will download the photo from internet otherwise it will search
	first local storage.
	
	*/
	
	void getProfilePicForID(const char* userFacebookID, int width, int height, bool forceDownload);
```

#### To send request to user friends.

```ruby
	/* You can specify whether a request is Invite, Challenge or Gift Type. 
		- FB_REQUEST::REQUEST_GIFT
		- FB_REQUEST::REQUEST_CHALLENGE
		- FB_REQUEST::REQUEST_INVITE
		
	If can pass an array of CCStrings (of friend's Facebook ID) if you want to send request to particular friends.
	This function supports frictionless supports by default. So if user chooses frictionless request for a friend then 
	request will automatically send without showing any dialog box.
	
	You can also pass data dictionary with each object type as CCString only. For example:
	Key = GOLD (const char*), Value = 500 (CCString)
	Key = LIFE (const char*), Value = 1   (CCString)
	
	Use data dictionary if you are sending gifts.
	
	*/
	
	void sendRequestToFriends(EziSocialWrapperNS::FB_REQUEST::TYPE requestType,
                              const char* message,
                              cocos2d::CCArray *selectedFriendIDs,
                              cocos2d::CCDictionary *dataDictionary);
    
```

- **JNI_EziSocialManager.cpp** file is also modified to supports these new functionality.

### Android / iOS
